You can declare properties on your custom element by adding them to the properties object on your prototype

Any property that’s part of your element’s public API should be declared in the properties object.

the properties object can be used to specify:

+ Property type.
+ Default value.
+ Property change observer. Calls a method whenever the property value changes.
+ Read-only status. Prevents accidental changes to the property value.
+ Computed property. Dynamically calculates a value based on other properties.




*** Reflecting properties to attributes ***

In specific cases, it may be useful to keep an HTML attribute value in sync with a property value. This may be achieved by setting reflectToAttribute: true on a property in the properties configuration object.
